    "### About today's Practical\n",
    "In this week's practical, you will learn and implement a powerful ranking model -- BERT reranker (aka monoBERT). Unlike traditional bag-of-words models such as BM25 or feature-based learning to rank models, BERT reranker uses transformer model (BERT) to encode query-document pairs and directly output estimated relevance scores, as the model architecture shown in the leacture:![monobert](monobert.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our life easier, in this practical, we use the most popular transformer python library called `transformers`, which is developed by [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/), to test the effectiveness of monoBERT. If you are interested in transformer models and NLP, we highly recommend you to have a look at their [lectures](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1). \n",
